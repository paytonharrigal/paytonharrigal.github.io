            <p>
                Hello, my name is Payton Harrigal, but hopefully you already know this since you decided to click on the website. Well here is a short summary of how I got to where I am. 
                I graduated from Goochland High School in 2018, where I played multiple sports and started training more seriously for triathlon. 
                I attended Virginia Tech for an Undergraduate Degree in Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise in order to further my knowledge about sports science and was a Certified Personal Trainer for about a year. 
                However, after exposure to different fields, including computer through an online Python class, I realized that I wanted to pursue another career path. 
                However, after exposure to different fields, including computer science through an online Python class, I realized that personal training was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 
                I realized that I wanted to pursue another career path. 
                I did some research and started on free online material for coding and ended up really liking it. 
                I enjoyed it mainly for the problem solving and creative aspect, as it felt very fulfilling when I was able to solve a problem. 
                I decided to pursue a Computer Science Undergraduate degree at the University of Maryland Global Campus while continuing my own personal studying and practicing outside of classes. 
                I am currently in my first year of the degree and plan to finish in 2024. 
                Thank you for taking the time to view my website and learn more about me!

                    <li>Configured an AWS EC2 to launch a minecraft server</li>
                    <li>Through the trouble shooting found that to run the server it needed at least 3 Gigabytes of RAM to run</li>
